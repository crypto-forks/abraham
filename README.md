# Abraham MVP

Minimum viable product for [Abraham](http://abraham.ai), an [autonomous artificial artist](https://medium.com/@genekogan/8384824a75c7).

This codebase implements an artificial artist who satisfies the requirements of autonomy, uniqueness, and originality. 

There is currently no [agreed-to architecture](http://abraham.ai/covenant) for Abraham. A study and design process is underway. Meanwhile, a playground for testing generative art procedures to be integrated into the mvp can be found in [Eden](https://github.com/abraham-ai/eden).
